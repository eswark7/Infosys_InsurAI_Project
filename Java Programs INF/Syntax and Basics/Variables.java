/*
Variables are containers for storing data values.

In Java, there are different types of variables, for example: String,int,float...

Identifiers :

All Java variables must be identified with unique names.
These unique names are called identifiers.
Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
Note: It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code:

The general rules for naming variables are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
Names must begin with a letter
Names should start with a lowercase letter, and cannot contain whitespace
Names can also begin with $ and _
Names are case-sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int or boolean) cannot be used as names
