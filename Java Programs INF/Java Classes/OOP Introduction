OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.


Class:

A class is like a blueprint/template.

It defines properties (variables) and behaviors (methods).

No memory is allocated for a class until an object is created.

Object:

An object is an instance of a class.

It uses the class blueprint to create a real-world entity in memory.

Objects can access the variables and methods of the class.

Example:

Class: Car

Objects: Volvo, Audi, Toyota
